# datafun-01-foundations

> Professional Python project: creating variables and running code.

## Project Planning

Think about different kinds of data - real or fictional.
Then think about a good name to hold that value in code.

1. A **True or False** value (e.g. `isWorking`, `isParent`, `hasPet`)
2. An **integer** (e.g. `year_starting_grad_school`)
3. A **floating point number** (e.g. `experience_factor`)
4. A **string of characters (text)** (e.g. `city`, `company_name`, `analytic_specialty`)
5. A **list of strings** (e.g., `skills`, `interests`, `favorite_teams`)

Following the example ([`app_case.py`](./src/datafun_01_foundations/app_case.py)),
decide on a name for each type of variable.
Name it according to Python conventions.
Signal the **type** of value that variable holds by using `type hints`.
**Initialize** the variable to some value.
After declaring these as global constant variables,
use Python **f-strings** (formatted strings) to display the information.

## Three Workflows

There are three workflows for analytics projects.

- 01: Set Up Machine (Once Per Machine)
- 02: Set Up Project (Once Per Project)
- 03: Daily Workflow (Working With Python Project Code)

## 01: Set Up Machine (Once Per Machine)

Follow the detailed instructions at:
[**01. Set Up Your Machine**](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/01-set-up-machine/)

🛑 Do not continue until all these steps are complete and verified.

## 02: Set Up Project (Once Per Project)

Follow the detailed instructions at:
[**02. Set Up Your Project**](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/02-set-up-project/)

Detailed instructions are provided to:

1. Sign in to GitHub, open this repository in your browser, and click **Copy this template** to get a copy in **YOURACCOUNT**.
2. Enable GitHub Pages.
3. Open a machine terminal in your `Repos` folder and clone your new repo.
4. Change directory into the repo, open the project in VS Code, and install recommended extensions.
5. Set up a project Python environment (managed by `uv`) and align VS Code with it.

Use the instructions above to get it ALL set up correctly.
Most people open a terminal on their machine (not VS Code), open in their Repos folder and run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/YOURACCOUNT/datafun-01-foundations

cd datafun-01-foundations
code .
```

With VS Code open, accept the Extension Recommendations (click `Install All` when asked).
Use VS Code menu option `Terminal` / `New Terminal` and run the following commands:

```shell
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade
```

You must be in the root project folder. If successful, you'll see a new `.venv` folder appear in the repo root (look up top, typically between `.github/` and `.vscode/`).

🛑 Do not continue until all these steps are complete and verified.

## 03: Daily Workflow (Working With Python Project Code)

We follow the detailed instructions at:
[**03. Daily Workflow**](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/03-daily-workflow/)

Commands are provided below to:

1. Git pull
2. Run and check the Python files
3. Build and serve project documentation
4. Save progress with Git add-commit-push
5. Update project files

VS Code should have only this project (datafun-01-foundations) open.
Use VS Code menu option `Terminal` / `New Terminal` and run the following commands:

```shell
git pull
```

In the same VS Code terminal, run the files:

```shell
uv run python src/datafun_01_foundations/app_case.py
uv run python src/datafun_01_foundations/app_yourname.py
```

If a command fails, verify:

- Only the datafun-01-foundations project is open in VS Code.
- The terminal is open in the project root folder.
- The `uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade` command completed successfully.

Hint: if you run `ls` in the terminal, you should see files including `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, and `uv.lock`.
Once these scripts run, that is a major milestone for Project 1. Celebrate!

Run Python checks and tests (as available):

```shell
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

Build and serve project documentation:

```shell
uv run mkdocs build --strict
uv run mkdocs serve
```

> To stop a running Python program, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

Save progress:

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "update"
# if any changes were made, rerun git add and git commit again
git push -u origin main
```

All these steps are explained in more detail in the [Pro-Analytics-02 Documentation](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/).

## Project Objectives

### Project Task 1. Personalize Your Documentation Links

Open [mkdocs.yaml](./mkdocs.yaml).
This file configures the associated project documentation website (powered by MkDocs)
Use CTRL+f to find each occurrence of the source GitHub account (e.g. `denisecase`).
Change each occurrence to point to your GitHub account instead (spacing and capitalization MUST match the URL of your GitHub account **exactly**.)

### Project Task 2. Personalize Your Python File

1. Rename `app_yourname.py` to reflect your name or alias.

- Find the file the file in the VS Code Explorer window (top icon on the left).
- Right-click / Rename.
- Follow conventions: name Python files in lower_snake_case, words joined with underscores, and using `.py` extension.

2. Edit this README.md file to change the run command to call your file instead.
   Use CTRL+f to search for `app_yourname.py` and replace all occurrences exactly.
3. Preview this README.md to make sure it still appears correctly.
   - Find README.md in the VS Code Explorer window (top icon on the left)
   - Right-click / Preview
   - Fix any issues.
4. Run the updated command to execute **your** Python script.

### Project Task 3. Implement Your Python File

1. Read the example code carefully **before** starting.
2. Open your file. Search for "TODO" items. VS Code has icons down the left. Use either TODO Tree (tree, at the bottom) or Search (second from top).
3. Complete each TODO carefully, one at a time.
4. After implementing a TODO, paste your run command in the terminal and hit Enter to re-run it.
5. When it runs without errors, delete the associated TODO command.
6. Keep working through each TODO.
7. When you finish, there should be **zero TODO occurrences** in your project.

**Save often**: After making any useful progress, follow the steps to git add-commit-push.

## Out of Scope

- You do not need to add to or modify `tests/`. They are provided for example only.
- You do NOT need to understand everything. Understanding grows as we go through the course.

## Stuck at >>> or ...

If you see something like this in your terminal: `>>>` or `...`
You accidentally started Python interactive mode.

Just press `Ctrl+c` (both keys together) - or `Ctrl+Z`, then `Enter` on Windows.
